This directory contains the GenomeTools Perl bindings.

To be able to use GenomeTools classes via Perl, you have to 'use' a module for
each class in your Perl script:

use GT;                           # always required
use GT::Core::Str;                # to use the 'Str' class
use GT::Core::Encseq;             # to use the 'Encseq' class
[...]

Also, make sure that this directory is added to the Perl module search path.
Either by calling ruby with the option -I or by adding this directory to the
PERLLIB or PERL5LIB environment variables.

Furthermore, you have to make sure that the GenomeTools shared libraries can be
be found by the dlopen(3) system call. For example, by adding the lib/
subdirectory of GenomeTools to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Finally, the bindings require that the C::DynaLib foreign function interface
is installed, which can be done via CPAN (see
http://search.cpan.org/~rurban/C-DynaLib-0.60/lib/C/DynaLib.pm).
